# This config file should contain all values that are not to be pushed on GITHUB
# Usually this means the paths.
# Exposing paths to a public repo exposes the internal structure of your server, and is not considered a good practice.
# My own paths have been obfuscated here.
# /datadir/ : is where I save the large data
# /projectdir/ : is where this github repo's local folder.
# /tmp/ : is a dir where Dask can write temporary data
