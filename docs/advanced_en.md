## Advanced options

- __Density factor__: This option allows the user to filter the analogue cities according to their population density. A larger density factor will result in the inclusion of more cities in the results of the analogue search. As the number of cities increases, the search time also increases.â€¯ 

- __Show all analogies__: By default, realizations with poor quality analogues are not shown. This option overrides the default setting.

- __Number of Simulations__: By default, 12 climate simulations from different models are used to generate the analogues, in order to properly represent the uncertainties in the future climate simulations. You may choose to increase this up to 24, or (not recommended) decrease this down to 6.

- __Choice of Analogue__: This option allows the user to change the algorithm for the selection of the best analogue for each city and climate index. By default, the analogue with the best score is chosen. Other options allow you to include either the analogue closest to the target city that is within 1 percentile of the best analogue, or the analogue with the population density closest to the target city within 1 percentile of the best analogue.

- __Sorting display option__: This option allows the user to change how the analogues are displayed on the results page. By default, a balance between the analogue quality and the simulation representativeness is used. As such, the first result is both a good analogue and a good representative member. Other sorting methods either prioritize analogue quality or prioritize the representativeness of each simulation.
