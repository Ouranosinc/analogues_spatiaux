## Advanced options

- __Density factor__: Changing this allows more or less cities within the search radius for analogues. Selecting more cities results a potentially more accurate result, but may take more time to locate the matches.

- __Show all analogies__: By default, realizations for which all analogues are of poor quality are not shown. This option overrides the default behaviour.

- __Number of Simulations__: By default, 12 simulations are chosen, to get a good representative spread of the future climate. You may choose to increase this up to 24, or (not recommended) decrease this down to 6.

- __Choice of Analogue__: This option allows you to choose how the best analogue for each city is chosen. By default, the analogue with the best score is chosen. Other options find analogues within 1 percentile of this optimum: the analogue which is closest to the target city or the analogue closest to the target city's population density.
