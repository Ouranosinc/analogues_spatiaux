## Advanced options

- __Density factor__: This option allows the user to filter the analog cities according to their population density. The larger the density factor is, the more cities will be compared during the analog search. As the number of cities increases, the search time also increases.

- __Show all analogies__: By default, realizations with poor quality analogues are not shown. This option overrides the default behaviour.

- __Number of Simulations__: By default, 12 climate simulations from different models are used to generate the analogues, in order to properly represent the uncertainties in the future climate simulations. You may choose to increase this up to 24, or (not recommended) decrease this down to 6.

- __Choice of Analogue__: This option allows the user to change the algorithm for the selection of the best analogue for each city and climate index. By default, the analogue with the best quality score is chosen. Other options obtain the closest analogue within the 1 percentile of the best analogue, or the analogue with the population density closest to the target city, within 1 percentile of the best analogue.

- __Sorting display option__: This option allows the user to change how the analogues are displayed on the results page. By default, a balance between the analogue quality and the simulation representativity is used, so that the first result is both a good analogue and a good representative member. The other sorting methods either prioritize the analogue quality, or prioritize the representativity of each simulation.
