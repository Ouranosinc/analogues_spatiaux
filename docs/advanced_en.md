## Advanced options

- __Density factor__: Changing this allows more or less cities within the search radius for analogues. Selecting more cities results a potentially more accurate result, but may take more time to locate the matches.

- __Realization sorting__: This option allows you to choose how the realizations are ordered on the top of the results page. By default, they are ordered by a combination of both the analogue's quality and the realization's representativeness (see above). You may choose to order by only the analogue quality, or only the realization representativeness score, or the product of both.

- __Analogy ranking__: This option allows you to choose how the best analogue for each city is chosen. By default, the analogue closest to the target city, within 1% of the minimal analogue quality, is chosen. Other options include choosing an analogue closest to other analogues, an analogue furthest from other analogues, or an analogue closest to the target city's population density.

- __Show all analogies__: By default, realizations for which all analogues are average or poor quality are not shown. This option overrides the default behaviour.
