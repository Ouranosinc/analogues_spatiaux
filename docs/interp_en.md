## How to interpret the results

__Summary Information__:

- __Analogue choice__: Above the map, there are up to 12 buttons, each one representing an analogue from a single climate model simulation.
By default, these are ordered so that the first one provides the best balance between the analogue quality and how well it compares to the ensemble mean (see Representativeness score below).
The colour of each button represents the quality of each analogue, green indicating an excellent analogue, blue a good analogue and yellow an average analogue.

- __Map__: The map shows all analogues as coloured dots linked to the target city (shown as a purple star).
As described above, the colour of each dot represents the quality of the analogue, with green indicating an excellent analogue, blue a good analogue and yellow an average analogue.

- __Analogue quality__: This score indicates how well the current conditions at the analogue’s location align with the projected conditions of the target city
for the chosen climate indices when compared to all other possible locations. For example, if the quality score is in the 10th percentile,
there is a 10% chance of having a better analogue by choosing another random point within North America.
Details on the calculation of this quality score are given in the downloadable report at the bottom of this page. 

- __Representativeness score__: This is a measure of how well a particular climate model’s analogue aligns with the average of all climate models in the ensemble.
The lower this score, the closer the model is to the ensemble mean. It is possible, however, for a poor analogue to have a high representativeness score as this metric is independent of the analogue quality. 

- __Summary table__: This table shows summary information for the selected analogue, including the population density and the distance, in kilometres, to the target city.

- __Data export__: This section allows for the download of analogue data in a variety of different formats, including comma-separated values (.csv) and NetCDF (.nc).

__Climate Indices__: Underneath the map, each selected climate index generates three plots when clicked on: (1) the distribution comparison, (2) the average change, and (3) the full timeseries. Information on the analogue quality for each individual indiex is also available.

- __Distribution comparison__: This plot shows the probability distribution of the climate index in the present (white with purple hatching),
and in the future (purple) for the target city, as well as the analogue’s distribution in the present.
Note that the colour of the analogue’s present distribution changes according to the overall quality of the analogue,
i.e., green indicates an excellent analogue, blue a good analogue and yellow an average analogue. It can help you decide if the analogue is appropriate or not. 

- __Average change__: This plot shows the average change in the climate index of interest, along with the 10, 25, 75, and 90th percentiles. The white star indicates the target city’s present value for the climate index shown, the purple star indicates the target city’s future value and the coloured circle the analogue’s present value. 

- __Full timeseries__: This plot shows the full time series of the climate index (purple) for the chosen analogue for the target city.
Also shown are the present values for the analogue city (coloured according to the analogue quality); this is also plotted over the future time period to aid in comparison.
Finally, the median and range (10th to 90th percentile) of the climate model ensemble are shown in grey.
