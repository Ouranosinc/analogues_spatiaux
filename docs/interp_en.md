## How to interpret the results

__Summary Information__:

- __Analogue Choice__: On top of the map, there are up to 12 button which show a climate analogue for each realization of the ensemble. By default, these are ordered so that the first analogue is a good representation of its realization, and the realization is a good representation of the ensemble average. They are colored so that the best analogues are in green.

- __Map__: The map shows all best analogues as a coloured dot linked to the target city (shown as a purple star). The colour of each dot is related to the quality of the analogue. Users may change the analogue with the buttons above the map.

- __Analogy Quality__: This quantity represents the rank of the analogue with respect to the chosen index combination. For example, if the score maps to the 50th percentile, there is a 50/50 chance of having a better analogue by choosing another random point within North Amarica. The button colours of each analogue represent their quality.

- __Representativeness score__: This is a measure of how well a realization is represented by the ensemble mean, and is unrelated to the quality of an analogy.

__Variable information__: Each variable shows three plots: the distribution comparison, the average change, and the full timeseries.

- __Distribution comparison__: This plot shows the approximate probablity distribution of the variable in the present, in the future, and the analogue's distribution in the present, for the chosen realization. It can help you decide if the analogue is appropriate or not.

- __Average change__: This plot shows the average change of the variable in question, along with 10, 25, 75, and 90th percentiles.

- __Full timeseries__: This plot shows the full timeseries of the variable for the chosen realization, as well as other realization (in light gray). It also shows the analogue's climate in the present, and shifted forward into the future, to aid in comparison.
