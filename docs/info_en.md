# About: Spatial Analogues
__Spatial analogues__ are maps showing which areas have a 
present-day climate that is similar to the future climate 
of a given place. These types of maps can be useful for adapting to 
climate change, because they allow us to see how certain regions are coping today under 
specific climate conditions which will occur elsewhere in the future.

For example, Qu√©bec City may see an increase in heat waves in the future. 
As such, its municipal administration could learn from the experience and 
expertise of Detroit, in the United States, where heat waves are already 
more common, to prepare better-adapted intervention plans for 
the future climate.

By using spatial analogues, cities and regions can better understand the future impacts of climate change and take measures to prepare for them.
